# The Wiiteboard - a 10th grade project

In a school project in 10th (?) grade I made this drawing program that uses a Nintendo Wii remote instead of the mouse.
By pointing the IR camera in the Wii remote at the computer screen or projector, it can see the location of the tip of a pen fitted with a IR LED.

Considering I at the time did not know matrix maths nor linear algebra, and the programming-illiterate environment I grew up in, I'm impressed I managed to make this work.

I am however not able to reproduce the Python 2 runtime environment anymore on any modern distro.
Then I thought: can I preserve it using nix flakes?
Time to dip my toes into software preservation!
